I want to build some code so I can do a crude evaluation of how different newspapers treat different subjects over time. The rough outline is that it will download articles on the given subject for the given newspaper. Then, it will use sentiment analysis one each of the articles, and produce statistics/graphs of how positve/negative sentiment in the articles varies over time. Hopefully this will be enough to detect bias in newspapers. The kind of example I have in mind is "Has the NYT changed how it writes about the import-export bank of America to mirror the Democrat's political position?" The sentiment_classification package, trained on movie reviews, will be at best a crude tool for this, but hopefully I can get something meaningful.
